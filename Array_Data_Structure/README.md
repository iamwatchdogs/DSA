# Arrays

## What is an Array ?

`Array is` one of the simplest and common data structures `used to store a collection of similar data objects`.
One of the key feature of this data structure is that the `memory allocated` for th data object is `contiguous` which means for all the data objects / items a **continuous memory will be allocated**.
Take a note that Arrays store only a set of `similar objects / data items` which means we **can not store data object of different types**.

## Why do we need Array Data Structure ?

Arrays are one of the **Basic Data Structures** which is very easy to use and store effective the similar data objects.
Many other Data Structures are derived from Arrays based on the usage *( accessing, retrieving, modifying, e.t.c )* of Array in particular situations.
So, to understand the internal working of other Data Structures which are derived from Arrays, we need to have a clear-cut idea what are **Arrays**.
Some derived Data structures are :
- Stacks
- Queues
- Dequeues
- Vectors
- Linked Lists, e.t.c.

## What are the types of Arrays ?

Array Data Structure is basically of 2 types, and they are:
- Static Arrays

    > The Arrays which have a fixed memory capacity throughout the execution of the program are known as "Static Arrays".
    
    > For Example : Normally declared Arrays ( In C, C++, Java )

- Dynamic Arrays

    > The type of Arrays which has an ability to increasing and decrease the memory capacity within the runtime ( or ) throughout the execution of the program are known as "Dynamic Arrays".

    > For Example : Dynamic allocated memory ( In C ), Vectors ( In C ++ ), ArrayList ( In Java ) and List ( In Python )

## How do we implement Arrays data structures ?

The implementation of array changes from one programming language to another. 
So, we need to have a basic understanding of how the arrays work to implement it in programming language with ease.
